        description: "by Jo Lammert, White Whale Games studio director.  White Whale Games started in summer of 2011 when Jo Lammert and two friends, spurred by a conversation about pulp fantasy and video games, decided to make a game company. Each member of the team had little to no experience in the industry, and the new company had next to no money; So how exactly did White Whale go from chatting about wizards and swords to releasing the critically-acclaimed God of Blades? Learn about the team's struggles and successes in indie game development--and how they were able to build a game studio with just a few ideas and an eagerness to learn.",

This is the implementation level view of how they got faster, how they proved it and where they are going from here. Mike Cravey is se√±or/managing UI Engineer at RetailMeNot where he is saving you money and bytes. He came to development the long way as a sys admin and then a designer. Mike fights for the rights of UI Engineering since many think they're just \"making it pretty\". Chris Holmok started writing code when the DeLorean went into production. Originally from Cleveland, OH, he has worked for MySpace, Microsoft, Knotice, and OEConnection. Chris enjoys making music, photography, drinking obscure European Liquors and has a cat named Betty.",

We'll talk about 3 different projects that mixed and matched Drupal and Node.js in different configurations and architectures to meet a variety of business goals. A website that featured a live-feed of new Drupal content being created during a live event, a web app that allows users to create and share magnetic poems on everything from a smartphone to the desktop, and a website that needed to pull in a staggering number of real time feeds.    Mike Minecki has been building websites since 1999. At Four Kitchens he helped build and architect a number of different projects that utilized both Node.js and Drupal. He has taught Node.js in Austin and San Fransisco, and has been speaking at events around the country about how to integrate Node.js and Drupal.",
